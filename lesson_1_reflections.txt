How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

- It highlighted all the differences so I didn't have to spot them myself.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

- Probably could save hours when something goes wrong (my experience with IBEX - What did I change??).

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

- Auto stored in a separate folder would be nice for when you forget, and you can ignore those commits otherwise.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- I imagine google assumes your files are independent, whereas with coding you often have interdependent files. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- ?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

- Because if you commit appropriately, you can always go back!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

- I want to use it for getting files on IBEX!
