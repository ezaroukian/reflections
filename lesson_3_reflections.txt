Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Similar to why you wouldn't want automatic commits. You might not be at a stage where you want other people too see what you've done (unfinished, buggy, etc), it might be a secret...

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks are on GitHub, clones give/re-give a local copy, branches extend something already existing

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- So you can work off-line and then be able to resolve conflicts that arose in the meanwhile

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- I way way prefer dropbox for everything I do. This has an infuriating number of steps that I really resist making changes or doing an appropriate number of commits/pushes.
