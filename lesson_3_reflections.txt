Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Similar to why you wouldn't want automatic commits. You might not be at a stage where you want other people too see what you've done (unfinished, buggy, etc), it might be a secret...

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks are on GitHub, clones give/re-give a local copy, branches extend something already existing
